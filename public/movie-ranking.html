<h1>My top 3 movies of all time</h1>
<h2>In no particular otder</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</h3>
<p>
  I love this movie because of 2 things: One is the cinematograpgy and secind is
  the story line where the main character lives a mundane life until he was
  faced with a problem that forces him to go on an adventure that he hsa always
  dreamed of.
</p>
<h3>The Big Short</h3>
<p>
  Honestly I am not too sure why I love this movie, but I just do. Something
  about finance and being ahead of teh curve, taking risks and then having it
  pay off.
</p>
<h3>Dune</h3>
<p>
  The cinematography, the score, and the storyline is what makes this movie a
  faborite of mine. Hans Zimmer was able to use music and sound to create
  ambience that is our of this world, literally.
